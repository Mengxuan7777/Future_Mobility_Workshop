            <p clss="writing">  Biking has grown rapidly in recent decades. It has great benefits to alleviate traffic congestion, improve physical health, cut carbon emissions. Shared bikes in big cities like New York have been widely accepted and utilized. It is not exaggerated to say that the blue Citi bike is becoming a new icon of New York as the yellow cab. Especially, during pandemic, biking is a great option for people and logistic to circulate in the city when considering comfortability and sanitariness.
                One of the most studied topics for bike sharing system is the bike surplus and shortage among different stations. The disbalance of demand-apply of shared bike raises is widely researched by different groups. The shared bike operators want to minimize the operational cost. The public dislike their pathway or activity space get blocked by bike stations. The government want to make policies and planning that integrate the shared bike system into the whole mobility network.
                Under this circumstance, understanding the ridership pattern and finding the role of shared bike system in mobility network has great significance. First, visualization of the utilization of shared bike stations helps us to understand which stations are most frequently used. Second, comparing the activeness of the start stations and end stations can indicate the habit of riders. Third, putting the shared bike stations into a network of urban context provides the lens of observing the interaction of shared bike and other mobility systems.
                The purpose of this paper is to examine the ridership pattern of shared bike in Manhattan by visualizing the utilization records. The data used for the analysis is from Citi Bike, the most popular shared bike provider in New York City.
                <br/> <br/>Citi Bike Data is generated by the NYC Bike Share, a limited liability corporation solely owned by Lyft. The data including trip records, a real time feed of station status and monthly reports. This data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system, trips that are taken to/from any “test” stations, and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure its secure).</p>
